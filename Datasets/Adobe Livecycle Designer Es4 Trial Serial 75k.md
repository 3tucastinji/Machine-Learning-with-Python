However, Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES4 is not a cheap software. It costs $299 for a single license, and you need to have Adobe Acrobat Pro or Adobe Acrobat Standard installed on your computer to use it. If you want to try it out before buying it, you can download a 30-day trial version from Adobe's website. But what if you want to extend your trial period beyond 30 days?
 
That's where the Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES4 Trial Serial 75k comes in. This is a special serial number that you can use to activate your trial version of Adobe LiveCycle Designer ES4 and enjoy its full features for up to 75,000 form submissions. That's more than enough time to test the software and see if it meets your needs.
