## What Critics and Audiences Say About Sarkar
 
Sarkar has received mixed reviews from critics and audiences alike. Some have praised the movie for its timely message, Vijay's performance and Murugadoss's direction, while others have criticized it for its weak villains, lengthy dialogues and lack of originality.
 
According to The Times of India, Sarkar is a smart film that has a good message but lacks strong antagonists. The review states that Vijay is in top form as Sundar, a corporate honcho who takes on the corrupt system, but the movie suffers from overlong songs and action scenes that cater to the mass audience[^1^]. The review also appreciates the effort to present facts and laws related to election processes.
 
The Hindu, on the other hand, calls Sarkar more a political pamphlet than a movie. The review points out that the movie has no well-defined characters and feels like a long lecture. It also says that the movie just scratches the surface by putting together a story based on a few recent incidents in the state[^2^]. The review praises Varalaxmi Sarathkumar for her smooth performance as a politician.
 
IMDb users have given Sarkar an average rating of 7.1 out of 10, based on over 19,000 votes. Some users have lauded the movie for its social message, Vijay's charisma and Murugadoss's style, while others have slammed it for its predictable plot, poor editing and unrealistic scenes. One user writes that Sarkar is a very good crime film, and its value is quite notable particularly in comparison to the majority of Hindi films made around those years, which were not as good in technical quality as this one is[^3^]. Another user writes that Sarkar is a disappointment and a waste of time[^4^].
