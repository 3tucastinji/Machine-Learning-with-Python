- **Pattern Designer**: This module allows you to create and edit patterns using various drawing tools, such as lines, curves, points, angles and measurements. You can also import patterns from other software such as Gerber, Lectra or DXF files[^3^]. Pattern Designer also supports digitizing patterns using a digitizer board[^1^].
- **Planner Expert**: This module helps you plan and optimize your production process by creating cut plans, generating markers and calculating fabric consumption. You can also export cut plans to various cutting machines or plotter formats[^1^].
- **Nest Expert**: This module uses advanced algorithms to automatically nest your patterns on the fabric, maximizing material utilization and minimizing waste. You can also manually adjust the nesting results or use interactive nesting tools[^1^].
- **Vision Cut**: This module controls the cutting machines and monitors the cutting process. It also provides feedback on the cutting quality and efficiency[^1^].

- **AutomART**: This module enables you to create and customize digital prints for your garments. You can import images, logos, texts or graphics and apply them to your patterns. You can also adjust the print parameters such as size, position, rotation and color. AutomART also optimizes the print layout and reduces the print time and dye consumption[^2^].
- **Made to Measure**: This module allows you to offer personalized products to your customers based on their measurements and preferences. You can create online forms where customers can enter their data and choose their style options. Made to Measure then automatically generates production-ready files based on predefined style alteration rules[^2^].
